I'm a hobbyist programmer and (very) occasionally game developer.

My main area of interest is currently compilers and programming language development.

Main languages are <a href="https://github.com/thinker227?tab=repositories&type=source&language=c%23&sort=stargazers"><img src="./csharp.png" width="30" height="30" align=center alt="C#" title="Repos written in C#"></a> and sometimes <a href="https://www.google.com/teapot"><img src="./haskell.png" width="30" height="30" align=center alt="Haskell" title="I don't have any repos written in Haskell yet qwq"></a> if I'm feeling adventureous.

Currently working on various programming language development-related things, as well as miscellaneous side-projects whenever I feel like it.
